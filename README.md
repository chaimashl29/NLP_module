# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Coursework and Mini-Projects

This repository contains practical work (TPs) and mini-projects related to Natural Language Processing (NLP) as part of the second year of the Master’s in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science (IASD) at the École Nationale Supérieure d'Informatique (ESI), Sidi Bel Abbes.

## TP-01: Preprocessing in NLP
This TP focuses on essential preprocessing techniques such as:
- Tokenization
- Lowercasing
- Stopword removal
- Lemmatization and stemming

## TP-02: Feature Extraction and Embeddings
This TP introduces feature extraction techniques and word embeddings like:
- Bag of Words (BoW)
- TF-IDF
- Word2Vec
- GloVe

## TP-03: Improvement of TP-02
In this TP, the goal is to enhance the feature extraction techniques from TP-02 by improving the model performance and experimenting with advanced embedding techniques.

## TP-04: Sequence Models
This TP delves into sequence models used in NLP, such as:
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs)
- Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)

## TP-05: Machine Translation (English to French)
The goal of this TP is to build a basic machine translation model from English to French using sequence models or transformers.

## Mini Projects

### Project 1: Flickr8k Image Captioning using CNNs & LSTMs
This project involves generating image captions using a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and LSTMs for sequence generation. It is based on the Flickr8k dataset.

### Project 2: Image Captioning with Transformers (Flickr8k)
This project enhances image captioning by using Transformers, a more modern architecture compared to CNN-LSTM models, leveraging the attention mechanism to improve the captioning process on the Flickr8k dataset. An attached report is included.
